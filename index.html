                        <h3>Jubilee Austen Portfolio</h3>
                        <h4>Hand-coded HTML and CSS</h4>
                        <p>This portfolio site was hand-coded from scratch to match a pre-designed comp.  Without any provided HTML or CSS, I was able to further explore the relationship between the two languages.  The final result matched the comp perfectly.  This project motivated me to begin branching out and putting my own ideas to the test!</p>

                        <p>The simplicity of this page is misleading.  Without any guidance, and only a comp for reference, the site was to be hand-coded from scratch.  Though the task was intimidating at first, I was very pleased to find that my coding skills were up to the challenge.  In less than two hours, my page was a pixel-perfect match.</p>

                        <p>This collection of recipe cards was styled from an existing comp and style guide.  Although the HTML was provided, the CSS was not.  Matching alignments, creating the layout, adding the  images, and styling text resulted in an eye-pleasing page that looks "good enough to eat".</p>

                    As an artistic, creative person with a passion for problem-solving, my path clearly leads to a career in web design and development.<br><br>
                        Armed with a degree in visual art education, and years of teaching design, I took on the world of coding.  After one day of courses, I knew that I was heading in the right direction.  Now, having completed courses in HTML, CSS, Photoshop and Illustrator, I cannot wait to put my talent and technical skills to use!<br><br>
